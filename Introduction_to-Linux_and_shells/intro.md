<h1>Linux & Terminal Commands</h1>

<h2>Why use command line?<h2>
<h3>More control over your machine</h3>
Mastering the command line gives you far greater control over your machine.
You can run commands to change permissions, view hidden files, interact with database, start servers, manage processes, etc.

<h3>And it’s faster</h3>
Once you learn the basic commands and commit them to memory, you can perform tasks much faster than you could using a GUI.
There is a bit of learning curve, but it’s 100% worth it.

<h3>Needed  for cloud  computing </h3>
Most cloud services are operated via a command line interface. If you plan on running any projects in the cloud or using cloud resource, you’ll need command line skills.

<h2>So, what is Unix? </h2>
Unix was an operating system developed at Bell labs in the mid-1960s.
Unix is the “grandfather” of many modern operating systems that we frequently use today.

<h2>GNU</h2>
Richard Stallman was a leader in the group pf developers who aimed to create free software alternative to Unix.
In 1984, he began work on the GNU project, with the goal of creating an operating system that included “everything that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not Free”<br>

<h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
Another developer, Linux Torvalds, was 
working on creating his own Kerner known as Linux.
The Kernel is the part of an OS that facilities interactions between hardware and software.
At that time, many GNU “pieces” were complete, but it lacked a kernel.
Torvalds combined his kernel with the existing GNU components to create a full operating system.

<h2>Linux Distributions</h2>
A Linux distribution bundles together the Linux Kernel, GNU tools, documentation, a package manager, a window system, and desktop environment.

<h2>Shell</h2>
A shell is a computer interface to an operating system.
Shells expose the os’s services to human users or other programs.
The shell takes our commands and gives them to the operating system to perform. 

<h2>Terminal</h2> 
A terminal ia a program that runs a shell.
